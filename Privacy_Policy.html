                <p>A cookie is a small amount of information that’s downloaded to your computer or device when you visit our Site. We use a number of different cookies, including functional, performance, advertising, and social media or content cookies.</p>
                <p>Cookies make your Browse experience better by allowing the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login and region selection). This means you don’t have to re-enter this information each time you return to the site or browse from one page to another. Cookies also provide information about how people use the website, for instance whether it’s their first time visiting or if they are a frequent visitor.</p>
                <p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Necessary for the website to function (e.g., maintaining shopping cart across pages).</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Cookies:</strong> Collect information about how you use our website (e.g., pages visited, loading errors) to improve performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> Remember your choices and preferences (e.g., language, region) to provide a more personalized experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising/Targeting Cookies:</strong> Used to deliver ads more relevant to you and your interests.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies last until you stop Browse and persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted. Most of the cookies we use are persistent and will expire between 30 minutes and two years from the date they are downloaded to your device.</p>
                <p>You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Please keep in mind that removing or blocking cookies can negatively impact your user experience and parts of our website may no longer be fully accessible. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can choose whether or not to accept cookies through your browser controls, often found in your browser’s “Tools” or “Preferences” menu.
